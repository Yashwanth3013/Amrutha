                            According to the Center of Innovative Technology (CIT) Board of Directors, Amruta Incâ€™s ability to perform the research and commercialization and to further the goals set forth in the Commonwealth Research and Technology Strategic Roadmap, are critically important in the granting of this award.



                            Amruta Inc participated in the reception hosted by Governor Ralph Northam honoring the recipients of the CRCF grants on November 12, 2019 at the Executive Mansion in Richmond, Virginia.
